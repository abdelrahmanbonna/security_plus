   - Location provider verification
   - Coordinate validation
   - Runtime permission handling

4. **Storage Security**
   - External storage monitoring
   - App installation location verification
   - Storage permission analysis
   - File system integrity checks

## Security Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Permission Management**
   ```dart
   // Always check permissions before security checks
   if (Platform.isAndroid) {
     final locationStatus = await Permission.location.request();
     if (!locationStatus.isGranted) {
       // Handle permission denied case appropriately
       return;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```dart
   try {
     final isSecure = await SecurityPlus.isRooted;
     if (isSecure) {
       // Implement appropriate security response
       await handleSecurityBreach();
     }
   } catch (e) {
     // Always handle exceptions gracefully
     await logSecurityException(e);
   }
   ```

3. **Multiple Verification Layers**
   - Combine multiple security checks
   - Implement time-based verification
   - Use progressive security responses
   - Maintain security logs

4. **Response Strategies**
   - App termination for critical breaches
   - Feature limitation for suspicious activity
   - User notification for security concerns
   - Secure data wiping when necessary

## Required Permissions

### Android
```xml
<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
</manifest>
```

### iOS
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Required for security verification</string>
```
